## texlive-fonts-fontawesome

This is just the two FontAwesome fonts from the much larger texlive-fonstextra package from the official Arch repos. I am using texlive in a container, so I wanted the image to be as small as possible. I only need one font from this larger package, so I packaged up just that font (or two) to save 1.3 gigabytes of installed space.

To install

```bash
makepkg -sri
```

AUR package coming soon.
